## Dataset Access

The dataset used in this study can be downloaded from Kaggle:

ðŸ”— https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arjuntejaswi/plant-village](https://www.kaggle.com/code/abdmental01/paddy-disease-clean-solution

After downloading, place the dataset as:
data/
â”œâ”€â”€ TRAIN_DATASET/
â””â”€â”€ VALIDATION_DATASET/


Paths can be changed in the R scripts if needed.

## Pretrained Models

Download pretrained models from the `models/` folder.

Models available:
- `hybrid_cnn_finetuned.h5` âœ… Best model
- `resnet50_finetuned.h5`
- `densenet121_finetuned.h5`
- `inceptionv3_finetuned.h5`
- `hybrid_simple_preds.rds` (prediction output)

These allow users to reproduce results **without retraining**.
