## üìä Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Paddy Disease Clean Solution:  
https://www.kaggle.com/code/abdmental01/paddy-disease-clean-solution

After downloading:
data/
1. TRAIN_DATASET/
2. VALIDATION_DATASET/

Paths can be updated inside the R scripts.

## ‚úÖ Pretrained Models

Models can be downloaded directly from the `models/` folder:

- resnet50_finetuned.h5  
- densenet121_finetuned.h5  
- inceptionv3_finetuned.h5  
- hybrid_simple_preds.rds (saved predictions)

These allow users to reproduce results without retraining.
